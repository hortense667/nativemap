Item-level Exceptions
---------------------
Some items include very short descriptive text. If, in rare cases, a snippet is
considered an adaptation of a source that requires ShareAlike (e.g., Wikipedia),
that item's "Text license" will be explicitly marked as CC BY-SA 4.0 in
CREDIT.md. When such an exception is noted, only that snippet is licensed under

Notes
-----
- Short factual descriptions are authored originally; no verbatim text from
  Wikipedia or other sources is included.
- Consulting public sources (including Wikipedia) for fact-checking does not, by
  itself, import their licenses because no protected expression is reused.
- This license does not grant rights to third-party trademarks, portraits, or
  privacy-sensitive content referenced by the data. Ensure compliance for your use.
